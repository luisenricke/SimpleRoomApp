# Simple Room App

This project provides an opportunity to explore and learn about the Room library. In addition, a module will be created for some preconfigurations to save time in future projects.

The repository contains a number of branches:

* ``master``: Here it is possible to have the implementation of a basic configuration of a database with its entities, DAO's and relations. Also in it you will find the unit tests of the one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many relationships.
* ``ExternalDatabase``: Here it is possible to find the implementation of export a database externally with a ``.db`` file. To do this successfully it will be necessary to use the migrations.
